Hello and welcome to my blog.

I'm Nicolas, I'm from Belgium and I love tech. Today I decicded to make this blog using Jekyll and host it on Github because it's free and I don't care about having a domain yet.I started this blog as a way to start collecting my thoughts on certain topics in a way that is shareable. My interests are varied spanning from photography, climbing, AI, tech, productivity, to other business related topics. Expect anything that might come through my mind that I feel is worth sharing here.

Thanks for joining and reading the blog. I'm honestly just writing for myself, so I'm surprised you even managed to find it.

Nicolas Delahousse
